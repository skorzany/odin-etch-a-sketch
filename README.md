# odin-etch-a-sketch
A browser version of an etch-a-sketch toy.<br>
Allows user to draw on the screen just by moving the mouse pointer around.<br>
User is allowed to change the canvas size, from 1x1 to 100x100 inclusive.

You can view it on [GitHub Pages](https://skorzany.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/).

There's **no styling**, the goal was to practice DOM manipulation and *event delegation*.

## Additional notes
 - Although the best effect was achieved by coloring each pixel 'black', there was *extra credit* for randomizing each pixel's color, so I did that.<br>
 - Additionally, I have implemented a progressive darkening effect, meaning that each interaction darkens the pixel by 10%.
